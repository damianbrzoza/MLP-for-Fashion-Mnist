# MLP-for-Fashion-Mnist
MLP model (Numpy only) for fashion-mnist dataset

`Fashion-MNIST` is a dataset of [Zalando](https://jobs.zalando.com/tech/)'s article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. We intend `Fashion-MNIST` to serve as a direct **drop-in replacement** for the original [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.
