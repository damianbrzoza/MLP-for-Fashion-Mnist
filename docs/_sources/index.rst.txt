MLP model (Numpy only) for fashion-mnist dataset

`Fashion-MNIST` is a dataset of Zalando's `article <https://jobs.zalando.com/tech/>`_ imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. We intend `Fashion-MNIST` to serve as a direct for the `original <http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/>`_ for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

This project is solution to this problem using only numpy to build and evaluate MLP model


The source code is available `here <https://github.com/damianbrzoza/MLP-for-Fashion-Mnist>`_.
